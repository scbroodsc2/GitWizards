Wizards for StarCraft 2 Data editor

These Wizards are files to generate data within the SC2 editor. They can be opened and modified using any text editor.

To use them, 
1. Create a folder within your sc2 installation repertory and move the Wizard file there. (Though it can be anywhere on your computer)
2. In the SC2 Editor, open File -> Preferences -> Wizards, and Add your folder there.
3. You will now be able to use the wizards when in the Data editor under Wizards -> Run Wizard -> TheWizardFile

Feel free to give suggestions in the SC2Mapster discord under the "Portfolios-projects -> Fenix Wizard Projects"
